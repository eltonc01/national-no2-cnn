This is code for the manuscript entitled, "National Ground Level NO<sub>2</sub> Predictions Via Satellite Imagery Based Convolutional Neural Networks."

As of now, the code contains one file, which is an example of a single train test split for daily prediction. This file contains the full model architecture, as well as the general pipeline of evaluation used in this study. We are working on preparing the rest of our code into a public-ready state, in which we will be uploading these notebooks ASAP.
